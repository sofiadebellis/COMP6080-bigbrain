UI
**Basic visual design principals**
Alignment: 
-	dashboard appears in a gird like layout,
-	consistent box layout with vertically stacked input fields used for all forms,
-	clean and organised nav bar,
-	grid like layout while playing the quiz,
all in combination fulfill the natural preference of humans to like elements aligned and consistent.

Fonts:
We have used one font ‘Poppins’ throughout our application as having consistent fonts reduces confusion. Additionally, we used defined font types (i.e h1, h2, h, h4, p) throughout our application to ensure consistency of font size throughout.

Colours:
The small colour palate we have used throughout this application is comprised of:
-	white,
-	black,
-	#f8f9fd (Light grey),
-	#f7595a (Watermelon pink),
-	#f35586 (watermelon orange),
-	#5be63c (light green).
The first four colours were used frequently throughout the application on text, background, buttons and more. While the fifth colour (watermelon orange) was sued specifically for our gradient and the final colour (light green) was exclusively used to highlight which answers the player has selected when playing a game. We chose these colours as using a harmonious set of colours makes the design of our application not only look right but also look clean and recognisable.

**Visual hierarchy**
1.	Size: since bigger means important we were sure to make sure important buttons such as ‘save changes’ took up a prominent section of the screen
2.	Colour: given that brighter means important we were sure to ensure that important elements such as the nav bar and important buttons were not white text on a black background and instead were in most cases white text with the watermelon pink background (or inverted) with hover properties.
3.	Contrast: since contrasting elements draw attention, we were sure to use a contrasting colour (light green) to our primary colour (watermelon pink) to make it clear to the user which answers they had selected when playing the game.


**Affordance**
Explicit:
Given an explicit affordance tell users how to interact we make most of our interactive element’s nature like so as we believe it is the most user friendly and does not required any previous knowledge of common icons or patterns. This can be seen in our nav bar, save changes buttons, register buttons, sign up button, get started button, edit button, play button and delete button in a few cases.

Pattern:
We implied an interaction is possible through pattern affordance in the mobile view of our application, whereby the hamburger icon is used to imply a menu and when pressed expand the navigation options. Another example is that our logo ‘BigBrain’ in the top left of our nav bar is clickable as this is common in many applications and in our case it redirects users to the dashboard page.

False:
We did not use false affordance in our application as confuses the user since it shows indication that it would do something it can’t do.


UX
**Accessible typography - Font choice**
Through the use of the google Poppins font, we were able to improve user experience for people with cognitive disabilities since "Some popular fonts, such as Poppins, have proven to be readable with individuals who have cognitive disabilities."

**Hovering a clickable elements**
Any buttons that are evidently clickable such as "Play", "Edit", “Delete”, "Save changes" and “submit” are shaped clearly like a button and change opacity or colour with a change of cursor to show that they are clickable buttons to perform an action. Overall, these changes also help with user experience  as it makes it clear what elements on the page are clickable.

**Shadows on the quizzes:**
Through implementing a hoverable shadow on the quizzes on the dashboard it is clear for the user to know what quiz their cursor is currently  hovering on and what is the current focus on the screen. This also draws attention to the quiz they are currently on, hence improving the user experience.

**Nav bar:**
Through creating a navigation bar with textual prompts, it is clear to the user what options are available within the website. Overall, this increases user experience of our website as it is clear and easy on how to navigate throughout the website.

**Image - Alt text:**
Through implementing alt text for all images used to convey the “why” of the image as it relates to the content of the webpage, while also enabling screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the page. Evidently, increasing the user experience of the application.
	
**Indication of required fields**
Through adding a asterisk next to the labels of required field, it is clear to the used which field of input are required. This ultimately increases the user experience of our application.

**Error modal**
Through having an error modal that displays a clear message as to where validation failed due to user input it is clear what mistake the user made and how they can fix it for next time. Furthermore, in using modals the error does not disappear after a certain amount of time and it is up to the user when the wish to close the error message, hence, improving the suer experience.

**Focused input box**
Through having input boxes that have the label move to the top of the box when typing in it and it also having the label and border change colour it is clear when the user is focused within a textbox. Evidently, increasing the user experience of our website.

**Keyboard compatibility**
Through implementing keyboard navigation accessibility, the experience of using our site is improved for those who are unable or prefer not to use a mouse, the keyboard is a primary method of navigating a computer. Other assistive technologies also rely on keyboard accessibility, including voice recognition and screen readers. Hence, by ensuring our site is keyboard compatible we have improved the user experience in our site.
